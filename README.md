## Description

This repository contains the FEniCS implementation for solving Poisson's equation ($\nabla^2 \Phi = 4\pi G \rho$) to calculate the Moon's gravitational potential ($\Phi$), along with the detailed project report.

## Repository Contents

1.  **`LunaDensidadUniforme.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook with the FEniCS code to calculate the gravitational potential assuming a **uniform lunar density**.
2.  **`informe_luna.pdf`**: The complete project report (**written in Spanish**) detailing the theory, implementation (for both uniform and polynomial density models), results, visualizations, and conclusions of the study.

## Core Technology

* FEniCS Project (Finite Element library for Python)
* Python 3.x
* NumPy

## Full Details

**All information regarding the theoretical background, detailed methodology (including variational formulation, boundary conditions, and both density models), complete results, plots, and discussion can be found exclusively in the `informe_luna.pdf` file (language: Spanish).**

## How to Run

To execute the `LunaDensidadUniforme.ipynb` notebook, a working installation of FEniCS and NumPy is required.
